Introduction
============

The goal of this project is to mimic a subset of the PDO api allowing
to use an existing API you're already familiar with when developing
with Crate.

Documentation / Supported fetch modes
=====================================

Since we are implementing an existing api the documentation available on
http://www.php.net/pdo also applies to this project.

On a side note, since we only support a subset of the PDO api only the
following fetch modes are supported.


For PDOStatement::fetchAll

- PDO::FETCH_NUM
- PDO::FETCH_NAMED
- PDO::FETCH_ASSOC
- PDO::FETCH_BOTH
- PDO::FETCH_FUNC
- PDO::FETCH_COLUMN

For PDOStatement::fetch

- PDO::FETCH_NAMED
- PDO::FETCH_ASSOC
- PDO::FETCH_BOTH
- PDO::FETCH_BOUND
- PDO::FETCH_NUM

Installation
============

Install the library by adding it manually to your ``composer.json`` or directly
via Composer_::

    composer require crate/crate-pdo:~0.3.0

.. _Composer: https://packagist.org/

Connect to Crate
----------------

To connect to your cluster, Crate follows standard PDO syntax to form a data
source name string (DSN_) and then connect to it.

::

  require 'vendor/autoload.php';
  use Crate\PDO\PDO as PDO;

  $dsn = 'crate:<HOSTNAME_OR_IP>:<PORT>';
  $connection = new PDO($dsn, null, null, null);


As Crate doesn't support authentication, the other parameters can be left null.

.. _DSN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_source_name

DSN
---

Following DSN is supported:
::

    crate:<HOSTNAME_OR_IP>:<PORT>

Example:
::

    crate:localhost:4200
