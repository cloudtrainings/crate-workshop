# Crate.IO JDBC Sample App Explanation
**Note:** The application is written in Java 8.

## Installation
The Crate.IO JDBC driver is hosted on [Bintray Repository](https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view) and available via [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter). To use the driver in your Maven project, add the Bintray repository and `crate-jdbc` dependency to the _pom.xml_ file.

### Maven

```xml
...
<repositories>
    ...
    <repository>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
        <id>central</id>
        <name>bintray</name>
        <url>http://dl.bintray.com/crate/crate</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
...
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.crate</groupId>
        <artifactId>crate-jdbc</artifactId>
        <version>...</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
```

To use `crate-jdbc` with Gradle build tool, add the following configuration to the Gradle file.

### Gradle

```gradle
   repositories {
        ...
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        compile 'io.crate:crate-jdbc:...'
        ...
    }
```

Alternatively, obtain the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) build configuration for the driver by clicking the _Set Me Up_ button on the Bintray drivers page.

There is also a standalone version of the Crate.IO JDBC driver named `crate-jdbc-standalone` which already includes its dependencies. You can download the latest standalone version directly from the [Bintray Repository](https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view/files/io/crate/crate-jdbc-standalone).

## Usage
### Connecting to Crate Server
The Crate JDBC driver class is `io.crate.client.jdbc.CrateDriver`. The following line of code loads the driver:

```java
    Class.forName("io.crate.client.jdbc.CrateDriver");
```

After the driver loads, establish a connection using the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method.

```java
     Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("crate://localhost:4300");
```

The `getConnection()` method always requires a database URL parameter. The database URL for `crate-jdbc` can take one of the following forms:

```java
[jdbc:]crate://<host>:<transport-port>[,<host>:<transport-port> , ...][/<schemaName>]
```

To connect to multiple Crate servers, list `host` and `transport-port` pairs and delimit them by a comma:

```java
jdbc:crate://host1.example.com:4300,host2.example.com:4300
```

The `jdbc:` prefix is optional and can be omitted.

### Executing statements
#### Executing single statement
The `createStatement()` method creates a single `Statement` object for sending SQL statements to the database. We can execute the statement by calling `execute()` method on the statement. Each method call returns `true` if the first result in `ResultSet` is an object or false if it's an update count or there are no result:

```java
boolean created = connection.createStatement().execute(
    "CREATE TABLE guestbook.posts (" +
    "    id STRING, " +
    "    text STRING INDEX USING FULLTEXT WITH (analyzer='english'), " +
    "    user OBJECT('strict') AS ( " +
    "        name STRING, " +
    "        location GEO_SHAPE " +
    "    ), " +
    "    image_ref STRING)"
);
```

To send parameterized SQL queries to the database, create a `PreparedStatement` object and set designated parameters of the statement to their corresponding values.

One of the cases in the Crate JDBC sample application where a prepared statement used is the insertion of a new blog post entry to the database:

```java
...
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(
    "INSERT INTO guestbook.posts (id, user, text, image_ref, created, like_count) " +
    "VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)");
    String id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    statement.setString(1, id);
    statement.setObject(2, post.get("user"));
    statement.setString(3, post.get("text"));
    statement.setString(4, post.get("image_ref"));
    statement.setLong(5, System.currentTimeMillis());
    statement.setLong(6, 0);
    statement.executeUpdate();
    ...
```

The `executeUpdate()` method executes the SQL statement in a `PreparedStatement` object which must be an SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

#### Executing multiple statements (bulk operations)
It's also possible to use parameter substitution in multiple parameterized statements at once.

This can be done by adding multiple statements to the batch and executing them with the `executeBatch()` method.

```java
...
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(
    "UPDATE guestbook.posts " +
    "SET text = ? " +
    "WHERE id = ?");

    statement.setString(1, "record");
    statement.setString(2, 1);
    statement.addBatch();

    statement.setString(1, "another record");
    statement.setString(2, 2);
    statement.addBatch();

    statement.setString(1, "yet another record");
    statement.setString(2, 3);
    statement.addBatch();

    int[] results = statement.executeBatch();
    ...
```

The resulting array contains one element for each command in the batch. The elements of the array are set in the order in which the statements were added to the batch.

### Fetching query results
The `executeQuery()` method executes the SQL query in the `PreparedStatement` object and returns the `ResultSet` object generated by the query. The `ResultSet` object represents a database result set. The data in `ResultSet` can be accessed through a cursor. Initially, the cursor points before the first row.

Using the sample application as an example, we can demonstrate the call of `executeQuery()` on `PreparedStatement`, extracting metadata from the `ResultSet` object and iterating through the data in it to build a map which represents a single record obtained from the database.

```java
public Map getPost(String id) throws SQLException {
    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(
        "SELECT p.*, c.name as country, c.geometry as area " +
        "FROM guestbook.posts AS p, guestbook.countries AS c " +
        "WHERE within(p.user['location'], c.geometry) " +
        "AND p.id = ?");

        statement.setString(1, id);
        ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
        return resultSetToMap.apply(resultSet);
}

private final Function<ResultSet, Map> resultSetToMap = rs -> {
    ResultSetMetaData rsMetaData = rs.getMetaData();
    int columns = rsMetaData.getColumnCount();
    HashMap<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
    while (rs.next()) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= columns; i++) {
            map.put(rsMetaData.getColumnName(i), rs.getObject(i));
        }
    }
    return map;
};
```

### Handling BLOBs
The Crate.IO JDBC Driver does not support operations with BLOBs. Therefore, in the sample application we use the Crate.IO [RESTful BLOB API](https://crate.io/docs/reference/blob.html) and [Apache HTTP components](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/) library to handle uploading, removing and retrieving BLOB data.

To upload a blob, the _sha1_ hash of the blob needs to be known as this will be used as the `id` of the new blob. In the app we decode the Base64 encoded string from the JSON payload which contains the blob into a newly allocated byte array and compute its _sha1_ digest:

```java
   post("/images", (request, response) -> {
       ...
       byte[] decoded = Base64.getDecoder().decode(blobMap.get("blob"));
       String digest = DigestUtils.shaHex(decoded);
       ...
   }, gson::toJson);
```

The blob can now be uploaded by issuing a `HttpPut` request where `body` is the decoded _Base64_ encoded string:

```java
   public Map<String, String> insertBlob(String digest, byte[] body) throws IOException {
       String uri = blobUri(digest);
       HttpPut put = new HttpPut(uri);
       if (body != null) {
           put.setEntity(new ByteArrayEntity(body));
       }
       CloseableHttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(put);
       ...
   }
```

If a blob already exists with the given hash an 'HTTP status code 409 Conflict' is returned.

To download a blob use an `HttpGet` request:

```java
   public CloseableHttpResponse getBlob(String digest) throws IOException {
       HttpGet get = new HttpGet(blobUri(digest));
       return httpClient.execute(get);
   }
```

To determine if a blob exists without downloading it use an `HttpHead` request:

```java
   public boolean blobExists(String digest) throws IOException {
       HttpHead head = new HttpHead(blobUri(digest));
       CloseableHttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(head);
       ...
   }
```

To delete a blob use an `HttpDelete` request:

```java
   public CloseableHttpResponse deleteBlob(String digest) throws IOException {
       HttpDelete delete = new HttpDelete(blobUri(digest));
       return httpClient.execute(delete);
  }
```

For all HTTP PUT, DELETE, and GET requests in the application the URI should have the following format:

```
http://localhost:4200/_blobs/guestbook_images/<digest>
```

If a blob does not exist an HTTP status code 404 Not Found is returned.
